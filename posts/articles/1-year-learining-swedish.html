            <p>About a year and a half ago I moved to Sweden. At first I didn't bother much with learning the language,
                but then I started to get interested in it. The first thing most people do when starting to learn a new language is download Duolingo, and I was no
                exception. However, after some time I started getting bored of it, as I found it too repetitive, and
                progress was very slow.</p>

            <p>So this is what I did instead: I started with <a href="https://www.pimsleur.com/learn-swedish/">Pimsleur</a>, which is a set of audio lesson that I found
                really helpful to begin being able to recognize some words and how the language works. I listened to it on the bus, while I was on my way to work for around one month, since it only has around 30 lessons.
            </p>

            <p> Another really good resource is Duo cards, which is a flashcard style app. You add words you want to learn, and I
                started adding words that I found on signs in the street and sentences that I stumbled upon. Gradually,
                as my vocabulary grew, it became easier to understand some sentences.
            </p>

            <p>Another really helpful resource was going to classes. I didn't miss on the free classes offered for people who
                move to Swedish, which is a good environment to practice and learn more, even if I only had class once a week
                for 3 hours. There are mixed oppinions on this program, but I only had good teachers, and I think it is a good tool, even if it's not the fastest way to learn.
            </p>

            <p>Learning a new language reminded me of how much work it actually is, but it is also really gratifying
                when you reach the level where you can understand what people around you are saying.</p>
