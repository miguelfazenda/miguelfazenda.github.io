            <p>After joining university, me and my great friend José Néves participated in a challenge to create a project using an Arduino.</p>
			
			<p>We won the Honorable Mention (2nd place) with our project, Warm Before Bath. It consists of a device that lets users program that they usually take a shower, and it will turn on a heater a few minutes before that time. </p>
            
            <p>It had an LCD and buttons, where the user can navigate through the interface. The time was kept with a Arduino compatible RTC (real-time clock), and the settings stored in an external EEPROM.
            A relay was used to turn on the heater, and a temperature sensor detects when the desired temperature is reached.</p>

			<p>We were very proud of our project, even if it was not the most complex or innovative. The prize of the challenge was an intership at <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a>.</p>

            <h3>Learnings</h3>

			<p>The main challenge with this project was implementing all the features, while using the Arduino's limited resources. We had to optimize the code quite a bit, and compromise on some things, as the Arduino's RAM is not very big.</p>
            
			<p>For example, in Arduino there is a function "F(str)", that stores a string in the flash memory instead of the RAM. This is useful when you have a lot of strings, as the RAM is very limited.</p>
