            <p>
                Me and some friends participated in a hackathon competition. We had to develop a project in 24 hours with the hardware avaliable there, and pitch it to a group of judges.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given the limitations, we decided to make a self-balancing table, and pitch it as a table to be sold to bars and restaurants. It would be able to balance a plates and glasses, even if the table was tilted.
            </p>
			<p>
				We used an Arduino, a gyroscope, and 2 servor motors on two axis to control the table's tilt. We 3D printed all of the the table's structure, using OnShape to design it.
				It was an learning experince for me, especially in 3D printing, as I had only done a OnShape introduction workshop before.
