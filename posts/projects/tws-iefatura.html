			<p>
				I have developed a software to help accounts to manage the invoices for things a company buys. They have
				to be included in the accounting software.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this pourpose, I have developed ie-Fatura. It logs in to the portuguese tax agency <a
					href="https://faturas.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/home.action">e-fatura website</a>, and scrapes the
				invoices' data, which is saved locally. The user can then review them, and categorize them for
				accounting purposes.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was developed in C#, using WinForms for the GUI, and the webscraping was done by reverse engineering
				the website's API. The data is saved in a JSON files.
			</p>

			<p>A licensing system was also implemented, to allow time-based licenses to be issued, and installed on the
				client's program. This program was sold to multiple accounting firms, and is still used to this day.</p>
